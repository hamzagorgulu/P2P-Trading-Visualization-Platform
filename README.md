# P2P-Trading-Visualization-Platform
Peer to Peer Trading is an energy trading model that peers can sell electricity to each other. We used GAMS to optimize this P2P trading and after that created this platform so that users can decide which asset the households have. Dash Plotly has been used in this platform so that we can show interactive graphs to users.
